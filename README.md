# Repository for different CCTBX tutorials

The `Start_cctbx.ipynb` is a basic Google Colab notebook with cells that install conda and the `cctbx-base` conda package, fixes some expected file locations, and runs a basic test showing cctbx functionality. This notebook can be a starting point for other tutorials.

To start the notebook, click on the [`Start_cctbx.ipynb` file](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_tutorials/blob/main/Start_cctbx.ipynb) and then click on the "Open in Colab" button. That will start the notebook in a Google Colab environment.

To copy the notebook for another tutorial, open `Start_cctbx.ipynb` in Google Colab. If you want to change the name of the notebook, you must save the notebook as a copy in your Google Drive. This will open a copy of the notebook in another window/tab. You can then change the name by clicking on the "Start_cctbx.ipynb" text near the top and typing your desired name. Then use the "Save a copy in GitHub" option under "File" to save a copy into a different directory in this repository or a separate repository. To put the copy in a directory, the full path, including directory names, need to be typed into the "File path" field.
