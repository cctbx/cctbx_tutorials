# Repository for different CCTBX tutorials

The `Start_cctbx.ipynb` is a basic Google Colab notebook with cells that install conda and the `cctbx-base` conda package, fixes some expected file locations, and runs a basic test showing cctbx functionality. This notebook can be a starting point for other tutorials.

To start the notebook, click on the [`Start_cctbx.ipynb` file](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_tutorials/blob/main/Start_cctbx.ipynb) and then click on the "Open in Colab" button. That will start the notebook in a Google Colab environment.
